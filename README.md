# Save the Links


In this application the user can save the links of the websites that interest him. 
The user can subsequently check his own Links and, if he wishes, he can modify and/or remove them.

I use Firebase to manage users and they can login/register with their email.
The users can also authenticate through Google mail.

Here is a [Live Demo](https://react-js-crud-firebase.vercel.app/).
